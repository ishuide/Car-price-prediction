 Problem Statement

To develop a Python-based application that helps users analyze and visualize trends in used Toyota Corolla car sales using real-world data. The project aims to extract insights from features like mileage, fuel type, age, engine specs, and equipment to understand their influence on car prices, and to create a tool for interactive data filtering, basic prediction, and intelligent insights.

Goal

✅ Cleaned and structured Toyota Corolla dataset
✅ Visual dashboard-style insights (plots, trends)
✅ SQLite-backed storage for cars with query functions
✅ A CLI (or GUI) tool that allows:

Filtering cars by features

Predicting price of a new input car

Comparing market and dataset prices (if scraping added)
