The project predicts the resale price of used cars based on features like fuel type, manufacturing year, mileage (km), horsepower, number of doors, and transmission type (automatic/manual).
* It uses Linear Regression wrapped inside a Scikit-learn Pipeline that includes preprocessing steps (encoding + scaling).
* Data is stored and retrieved using SQLite for clean, structured data handling.
* The final model is saved as a `.joblib` file for future use, so predictions can be made instantly without retraining.

Technical Workflow

1. Data Source

   * Dataset: `ToyotaCorolla.csv` (used car dataset)
   * Loaded → cleaned → inserted into a SQLite database (`database/car_data.db`)
   * Columns include attributes like `Fuel_Type`, `Mfg_Year`, `KM`, `HP`, `Doors`, `Automatic`, and `Price`.

2. Database Handling (`db_manager.py`)

   * Creates a local SQLite database and inserts the cleaned dataset.
   * Ensures table structure is automatically created if missing.
   * Allows querying all data for training.

3. Model Building (`model.py`)

   * Preprocessing:

     * `OneHotEncoder`: converts categorical variable (`fuel_type`) into numerical columns.
     * `StandardScaler`: normalizes numeric variables (`mfg_year`, `km`, `hp`, `doors`, `automatic`).
   * Model:

     * `LinearRegression`: learns the relationship between car features and price.
   * Pipeline:

     * Combines preprocessing and model into one reusable object.
   * Evaluation:

     * Dataset split: 80% train / 20% test.
     * Metrics: MAE, RMSE, R² score.
     * Top 10 feature coefficients displayed for interpretability.
   * Model Saving:

     * Stored as `models/price_linear_pipeline.joblib`.

4. Prediction Function

   * Loads the trained `.joblib` pipeline.
   * Accepts new user inputs (dictionary form).
   * Outputs predicted car price after automatic preprocessing.
