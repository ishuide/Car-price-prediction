in SQL
If a pandas column has dtype "object" → treat it as TEXT in SQLite.
Otherwise → treat it as REAL (SQLite’s floating‑point numeric type).
Example: if df has columns ["model", "mileage", "price"] with dtypes object, int64, float64, then:
model TEXT, mileage REAL, price REAL

Why are we using __name__="_main_" for every code?
It prevents your test/demo code from running every time the module is imported.
It lets the file serve two purposes:
As a reusable module (other scripts can import insert_data, query_all, etc.).
As a standalone script (when run directly, it runs the demo/test logic).
